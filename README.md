# Real-R-Intro
*This course will teach you how to apply R to all steps of the Data Science Workflow. On the first day we will define data science,learn basicR commands and explore first steps in Workflow, namely Munging and Visualisation. On the second day we will move on to using R on further steps in the Data Science Workflow - training models and testing them. We will do this by applying statistical learning models to various industry-relevant data science problems*
